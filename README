Description
===========

You'll find here all the open-source code I produce. This is just a collection of tiny utility scripts, patches, hacks and forks I want to or have to redistribute with the open source community at large.

If for any reason one of these hacks get momentum, I'll move them to a stand-alone and dedicated project.


Project list
============

drupify-fork
------------

This is a fork of the Drupify theme for Drupal 6.x. It holds all the modifications and hacks I added for Cool Cavemen's online shop (http://shop.coolcavemen.com).
